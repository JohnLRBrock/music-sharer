I was feeling burned out during my last  year of college. I had moved out of my parents house to an apartment just off campus and the stress of college was getting to me. After driving to my apartment from spending the weekend from my parents house, I was felt drained. This was during the time I was coming off of a two year long progressive rock kick, during which English Electric Part 1 was one of my favorite albums. When I had listened to the first few singles I fell in love with it, impulse bought the cd, and then wore out the grooves on the record.
