This is a project I've been wanting to make for a while. It's a simple social project where strangers can select music videos on youtube and share why that song is important to them.

The app uses a Rails back end, Postgresql database, and is hosted on Heroku. This project taught about building an app from inception to production and how important it is to think through how users will interact with the site.

The style is based off of Sakura https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura

The next feature I want to add is a comments section.
